## 2. Debugging

### Bug 1: Booking Date Validation
- **Description**: Dates in the past were being accepted for bookings
- **Location**: `BookingHistory.jsx`
- **Cause**: Missing date validation in the booking form

- **Screenshot**: [Add screenshot of the fix]

### Bug 2: Memory Leak in useEffect
- **Description**: Memory leak when component unmounts during API call
- **Location**: `BookingHistory.jsx`
- **Cause**: Missing cleanup in useEffect hook
- **Fix**: Added cleanup function to abort pending API requests
- **Screenshot**: [Add screenshot of the fix]

## 3. Reflection

The testing and debugging process helped identify several areas for improvement:

1. **Component Reliability**: The tests ensured that the BookingHistory component handles all possible states correctly.

2. **API Stability**: The Postman tests verified that the API endpoints work as expected and handle errors properly.

3. **Performance**: The debugging process revealed memory leaks that could affect application performance.

4. **User Experience**: The date validation bug fix improved the user experience by preventing invalid bookings.

5. **Code Quality**: The testing process helped maintain high code quality standards and catch potential issues early.

## 4. Recommendations

1. Implement more comprehensive error handling
2. Add input validation for all forms
3. Consider adding performance monitoring
4. Implement automated testing in CI/CD pipeline
5. Add more edge case tests
